I used some of my own references as well as these ones below. I was able to setup a lot of essential features like usb c flashing, 5v to 3v3, uart, and boot/reset buttons.

* [esp32-s3-wroom datasheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3-wroom-1_wroom-1u_datasheet_en.pdf)
* [user guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32s3/esp32-s3-devkitc-1/user_guide_v1.1.html)

**Total time spent: ~4 hours**
